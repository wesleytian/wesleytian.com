          <p>Hey,</p>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m Wesley. Iâ€™m an entrepreneur and I enjoy mountaineering and
            running.
          </p>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m the CEO and Co-Founder of Aragon. We generate realistic photos
            of people using AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have 1.4+ million users, including Fortune 500 companies and our
            products have generated 25+ million photos for people. Weâ€™ve raised
            a million dollars from Neo and the founders of billion-dollar
            companies but are proud to have never used any of the capital as
            weâ€™ve been able to build a capital-efficient business. Weâ€™ve been
            able to grow to $1M ARR within four months of launch and $4M ARR in
            under two years on profits alone.{' '}
          </p>
          <p>
            My company has been featured on the My First Million podcast, the
            Rolling Stone, the Washington Post, Entrepreneur, NBC News. Iâ€™ve
            also been invited to chat about my journey building Aragon on the
            Business Insider, Big Think Amazon, and the NeuralZen Venture
            Podcast, and soon Jomatech, Martyâ€™s friend and __.
          </p>
          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a huge proponent in boosting productivity by developing a
            healthy body and relationships. Besides working on improving my
            biomarkers such as my VO2max, I enjoy mountaineering, skiing,
            running, and lifting.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my dreams since I was a child is to climb the Seven Summits
            (the tallest mountain on every continent). Iâ€™ve climbed one and have
            six more to go.
          </p>
          Notable summits:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
              <p>
                In 2025, I convinced 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                Africa (19,000ft / 6,000m) with me. It took us 5 days to summit
                and 2 days to descend and one of us didnâ€™t make it due to
                altitude sickness. This climb was the most Iâ€™ve physically
                suffered (more than my Ironman race) due to getting food
                poisoning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Whitney (CA)
              <p>
                In 2019, I convinced 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                the contiguous US (14,505ft / 4000m) with me. We started at 1 am
                and it took us 17 hours to summit and descend. People usually
                split this climb into two days.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Fuji (Japan)
              <p>
                In 2015, I Convinced 3 friends to bullet hike Mt. Fuji (without
                staying overnight on the mountain) with me (12,000ft / 3,000m).
                It took us 16 hours to summit and descend. Itâ€™s now illegal to
                bullet hike Mt. Fuji due to people being injured from doing so.
                All 3 now refuse to hike.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Others: Mt. Olympus (Greece), Mt. Washington (NH), Mt. Diablo
              (CA), Mt. Tam, Mt. Jefferson, and many more.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2021, I trained for and finished an Ironman (a race consisting of
            a back-to-back 2.4-mile swim, 112-mike bike ride, and a full
            marathon). It took me 15 hours and is still the hardest physical
            thing Iâ€™ve accomplished to date. I can also do a standing backflip,
            ride a motorcycle, and am SCUBA certified.
