          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a huge proponent in boosting productivity by cultivating a
            healthy body and healthy relationships. Besides working on improving
            my biomarkers such as my VO2 max by running and maintaing my
            strength by lifting, I enjoy mountaineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my dreams since I was a child is to climb the Seven Summits
            (the tallest mountain on every continent). Iâ€™ve climbed one so far
            and have six more to go.
          </p>
          Notable summits:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
              <p>
                In 2025, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                Africa (19,341 ft / 5,895 m). It took us 5 days to summit and 2
                days to descend and one of us didnâ€™t make it due to altitude
                sickness. This climb was the most Iâ€™ve physically suffered (more
                than my Ironman race) due to getting food poisoning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Whitney (CA, US)
              <p>
                In 2019, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                the contiguous US (14,505 ft / 4,421 m). We started the climb at
                2 am and it took us 17 hours to summit and descend. People
                usually split this climb into two days.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Fuji (Japan)
              <p>
                In 2015, I organized 3 friends to bullet hike Japan's tallest
                mountain (without staying overnight on the mountain) with me
                (12,389 ft / 3,776 m). It took us 16 hours to summit and
                descend. Itâ€™s now illegal to bullet hike Mt. Fuji due to people
                being injured from doing so. All 3 now refuse to hike.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Others: Mt. Olympus (Greece), Mt. Washington (NH, US), Mt. Diablo
              (CA, US), Mt. Tam, Mt. Jefferson, and many more.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2021, I trained for and finished an Ironman (a race consisting of
            a back-to-back 2.4-mile swim, 112-mike bike ride, and a full
            marathon). It took me 15 hours and is still the hardest physical
            thing Iâ€™ve accomplished to date. I can also do a standing backflip,
            ride a motorcycle, and am SCUBA certified.

              I nearly failed high school playing League of Legends
              competitively (I made it to the top 1%). I also played 4 sports at
              the varsity level and 2 at the JV level.

              I was born in the SF Bay Area but didnâ€™t grow up there. Iâ€™ve since

              In high school, I voluntarily spent a summer being hazed at a
              military school in Kentucky. It closed shortly after I left due to
              unsafe conditions.
