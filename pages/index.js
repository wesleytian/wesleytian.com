              permeate the sciences, longevity research, robotics, and the
              commercialization of nuclear fusion. Nuclear propulsion is the
              only way we'll ever be able to escape our star system and explore
              the rest of the universe. Now wouldn't that be exciting?

                  I've moved around a lot growing up. Places where I've lived:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Born in Mountain View, CA</li>
                  <li>Milpitas, CA (5 years)</li>
                  <li>Oregon (1 year)</li>
                  <li>Taiwan (2 years)</li>
                  <li>Oregon (1 year)</li>
                  <li>Shanghai (8 years)</li>
                  <li>Massachusetts (2 years)</li>
                  <li>Michigan (3 years)</li>
                  <li>Nevada (1 year)</li>
                  <li>Milpitas, CA (1 year)</li>
                  <li>I currently live in San Francisco, CA (1 year)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These moves taught me adaptability, resilience, and
                  open-mindedness.

                  One of my biggest inspirations is my father, who was forced to
                  spend his teenage years manually farming due to China's
                  Cultural Revolution. He carried buckets of water on his
                  shoulders to his family everyday and has multiple scars on his
                  hands from using farming scythes. He never got the chance to
                  finish middle or high school. Through extreme grit, he
                  eventually made it to the USA, studied electrical engineering,
                  dropped out of his PhD, and moved to Silicon Valley to
                  contribute to the semiconductor and computing industry.
                  Against all odds, he's now the CEO of a public semiconductor
                  company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He's been an inspiration for my interest in deep tech, my
                  ambition for advancing humanity, and the belief that anything
                  is possible.

                  one of whom is a famous painter and art professor, and the

                During high school, I spent a summer attending military camp in
                Kentucky. It was as legit as you can imagine. We all got
                buzzcuts, the bathroom stalls had no doors, we had no access to
                electronics for the entire summer, we had to fold hospital
                corners every morning, we had PT at 5 am every morning, and.
