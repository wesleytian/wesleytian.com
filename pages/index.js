          <h4>Mountaineering & Triathlons</h4>
      
          üèîÔ∏è I enjoy climbing mountains. Here are a few notable
          experiences (click to expand):
          <ul>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}>
                Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,341 ft / 5,895 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In January 2025, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest
                mountain in Africa. It took us 5 days to summit and 2 days to
                descend. One of us was unable to summit due to altitude sickness
                which caused debilitating headaches, diarrhea, nausea, and
                extreme fatigue among us. At that extreme elevation, only ~50%
                of the oxygen at sea level was available to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Early in the climb, I got severe food poisoning. At one point,
                even water made me have explosive diarrhea. Despite that, I
                still had to hike through blistering sun, rain, sleet, stinging
                hail, and snow. Summit day started at 10 p.m., and we ended up
                hiking 17 hours that day. This was the most physical suffering
                I've ever endured‚Äìeven more than my Ironman.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}>
                Mt. Whitney (14,505 ft / 4,421 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In 2019, I organized three friends to climb the tallest mountain
                in the contiguous US. We started the climb at 2 am, and it took
                us 17 hours to summit and descend. People usually split this
                climb into two days. We ran out of water near the summit, so one
                of us had to drink piss to survive (we filtered it).
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}>
                Mt. Fuji (12,389 ft / 3,776 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In 2015, I organized 3 friends to "bullet climb" the tallest
                mountain in Japan, which means to summit and descend in a single
                push without staying overnight on the mountain. It took us 14
                hours total. It‚Äôs now forbidden to bullet climb Mt. Fuji because
                too many people have been injured from attempting it. My friends
                stopped hiking after this experience because of how challenging
                it was.
              </p>
            </details>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I've wanted to climb the Seven Summits (the highest mountain on each
            continent, including Mt. Everest) ever since I was a kid. I‚Äôve
            conquered one so far and have six more to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            üö¥üèª In 2021, I trained for and completed an Ironman Triathlon‚Äìa
            140.6-mile (226 km) endurance race consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, a
            112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile marathon, all done back-to-back,
            in Cozumel, Mexico, where it was 80&deg;F (27&deg;C) with 100%
            humidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right after I crossed the finish line, I collapsed from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyponatremia">hyponatremia </a> 
             and had to be carried away on a stretcher. For the first time in my
            life, I was scared that I had irreversibly fucked up my body‚Äìmy
            entire body was cramping, including my face, and I couldn't even
            open my fists. The race took me 15 hours to finish and it was the
            hardest physical thing I've ever done.
          </p>
          <p>
            üí™üèª I've also trained to do a muscle-up, land a standing backflip,
            and bench press two plates (225 lbs / 102 kg).

              High school was formative for me:
            <li>
              When I was 15, I attended a military camp in Kentucky. They shaved our heads as soon as we arrived, none of the bathroom stalls had doors, they made a guy run until he puked because he took too long to finish eating, I ate some ants, we had to wake up every morning at 4:30 a.m. to do physical training (PT), and more. The camp shut down soon after I left due to safety concerns and lawsuits filed against them.
            </li>
           
            <li> I
            was the worst League of Legends player in my grade and I wanted to be the best, so I put over a thousand hours into the game and eventually made it to semi-pro.
            </li>
            <li>
            I had a 1.9/4.0 GPA (C- average) during my junior year and I graduated at the bottom of my class. <a href="/posts/gpa">Blog Post</a></li>
            <li>I competed on 6 sports teams‚Äìtrack, cross country, tennis, table tennis, swimming, and basketball.</li>
