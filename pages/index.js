          <p>
            Prior to starting my company, I worked at 2 early-stage Y Combinator
            startups, was a software engineer at Microsoft, and an AI researcher
            at the University of Michigan.
          </p>
          <h4>Hobbies</h4>
          <p>
            I aim to balance my work with optimizing my health by sleeping
            early, running, and lifting. When time allows, I also enjoy pushing
            my physical limits and mental willpower with challenging activities
            like mountaineering and doing an Ironman.
          </p>
          I've climbed over a dozen mountains. Here are a few notable ones:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,341 ft / 5,895 m)
              <p>
                In January 2025, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest
                mountain in Africa. It took us 5 days to summit and 2 days to
                descend. One of us was unable to summit due to altitude
                sickness. At this extreme altitude, you have only have 50% of
                oxygen available to you. Due to getting food poisoning early on
                in the 7-day climb, this was the most I've physically suffered
                (even more than during my Ironman).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Whitney (14,505 ft / 4,421 m)
              <p>
                In 2019, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                the contiguous US. We started the climb at 2 am, and it took us
                17 hours to summit and descend. People usually split this climb
                into two days. We ran out of water near the summit, so one of us
                had to drink piss to survive (we filtered it).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Fuji (12,389 ft / 3,776 m)
              <p>
                In 2015, I organized 3 friends to "bullet climb" the tallest
                mountain in Japan, which means to summit and descend in a single
                push without staying overnight on the mountain. It took us 14
                hours total. Itâ€™s now forbidden to bullet climb Mt. Fuji because
                too many people have been injured from attempting it. My friends
                stopped hiking after this experience because of how challenging
                this climb was.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I've wanted to climb the Seven Summits (the highest mountains on
            each continent including Mt. Everest) ever since I was a kid. Iâ€™ve
            conquered one so far and have six more to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, I trained for and finished an Ironmanâ€“a race consisting of
            a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile marathon, all
            done back-to-back. It took me 15 hours to finish and it's been the
            hardest physical thing I've ever done.
          </p>
          <h4>Fun facts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area but didnâ€™t grow up there.
              I moved back 4 years ago and am proud to call it my home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Growing up, I lived in 3 countries and changed schools 7 times.
            </li>

            <li>
              In high school, I voluntarily spent a summer being hazed at a
              military school in Kentucky. I wanted to go for the experience
              (and it was a great one). It shut down shortly after I left due to
              safety concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
              I nearly failed high school with a 1.9 GPA because I was playing
              League of Legends competitively (I made it to the top 2% of
              players globally). I was also busy competing on 6 sports teamsâ€“4
              varsity and 2 JV.
            </li>
            <li>I've visited 25 countries and 6 continents.</li>
            <li>
              I have a cameo in Bryan Johnson's new Netflix documentary called{' '}
