          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>
            Iâ€™m a huge proponent of boosting productivity and creativity by
            cultivating a healthy body and healthy relationships. Besides
            working on improving my biomarkers such as my VO2 max by running and
            maintaining my strength by lifting, I enjoy mountaineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my dreams since I was a child is to climb the Seven Summits
            (the tallest mountain on every continent). Iâ€™ve climbed one so far
            and have six more to go.
          </p>
          I've climbed over a dozen mountains. Here are a few notable ones:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Mt. Kilimanjaro (Tanzania, 19,341 ft / 5,895 m)
              <p>
                In January 2025, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest
                mountain in Africa. It took us 5 days to summit and 2 days to
                descend. One of us was unable to summit due to altitude
                sickness. This climb was the most Iâ€™ve physically suffered (more
                than my Ironman race) due to getting food poisoning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Whitney (CA, US, 14,505 ft / 4,421 m)
              <p>
                In 2019, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                the contiguous US. We started the climb at 2 am and it took us
                17 hours to summit and descend. People usually split this climb
                into two days.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Mt. Fuji (Japan, 12,389 ft / 3,776 m)
              <p>
                In 2015, I organized 3 friends to "bullet climb" Japan's tallest
                mountainâ€“meaning we summitted in one push without staying
                overnight on the mountain in one of the huts. It took us 14
                hours to summit and descend. Itâ€™s now illegal to bullet climb
                Mt. Fuji due to the frequency of injuries from people attempting
                it. All 3 stopped hiking because of how hard it was.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In 2021, I trained for and finished an Ironman (a race consisting of
            a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile marathon run,
            done back-to-back-to-back and completed in that order). It took me
            15 hours to finish and is the hardest physical __. i've ever
            accomplished. I've also learned how to do a standing backflip, ride
            a motorcycle, and SCUBA dive.

            <li>
              I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area but didnâ€™t grow up there.
              I moved back 4 years ago and am proud to call it my home.
            </li>
            <li>
              Growing up, I lived in 3 different countries and changed schools 7
              times.
            </li>
            <li>
              In high school, I voluntarily spent a summer being hazed at a
              military school in Kentucky. It closed down shortly after I left
              due to unsafe conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              I nearly failed high school with a 1.9 GPA because I was focused
              on playing League of Legends competitively (I made it to the top
              2% of players globally). I was also busy playing 4 varsity sports
              and 2 JV.
