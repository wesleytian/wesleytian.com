						I was the first employee at Virtually (YC S20), an edtech SaaS startup. While there, I shipped over 200,000 lines of code, helped grow a product from 0 to over 10,000 paying users, and led an engineering team of 4. 

            Prior to that, I worked at Microsoft and double majored in computer science and data science at the University of Michigan „ÄΩÔ∏è.

            I'm currently focused on becoming a better engineer and entrepreneur by learning and building things. In the relatively short-term, my goal is to either bootstrap a business to $100K ARR or help found a unicorn (or both).
            
            üåé I've moved a lot growing up. So far, I've lived in
            ‚Ä¢ Milpitas, California (5 years)
            ‚Ä¢ West Linn, Oregon (3 years)
            ‚Ä¢ Taipei, Taiwan (2 years)
            ‚Ä¢ Shanghai, China (8 years)
            ‚Ä¢ Amherst, Massachusetts (2 years)
            ‚Ä¢ Ann Arbor, Michigan (3 years)
            ‚Ä¢ Reno, Nevada (1 year)
            I've since moved back to Milpitas, California.

            Physical activities have been a big part of my life. As a kid, my parents often took me swimming and hiking. In high school, I competed in track, cross country, swimming, tennis, table tennis, and basketball. I've also spent a considerable amount of time powerlifting, hiking, and mountain climbing.
            
            After finishing my first Ironman in a few weeks (a 2.4-mile swim, followed by a 112-mile bike ride and then a 26.2 mile marathon), I'd like to get back into hiking and mountain climbing. I plan to climb the Seven Summits and run an ultramarathon one day.
            
            In the past, I've also been a pianist and a violinist.

            My life philosophy can pretty much be reduced to "You only live once" and "Go big or go home".
