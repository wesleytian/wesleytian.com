          <h4>Hobbies</h4>
          <p>
            I aim to balance work and health by running, lifting, and cooking.
            When time allows, I also enjoy seeing what my body and mind are
            capable of with activities like mountaineering and completing an
            Ironman.
          </p>
          üèîÔ∏è I've climbed over a dozen mountains. Here are a few notable
          experiences:
          <ul>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
                Mt. Kilimanjaro (19,341 ft / 5,895 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In January 2025, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest
                mountain in Africa. It took us 5 days to summit and 2 days to
                descend. One of us was unable to summit due to altitude sickness
                which caused debilitating headaches, diarrhea, nausea, and
                extreme fatigue among us. At that extreme elevation, only ~50%
                of the oxygen at sea level was available to us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Early in the climb, I got severe food poisoning, and at one
                point, even water made me have explosive diarrhea. Despite that,
                I still had to hike through blistering sun, rain, sleet,
                stinging hail, and snow. Summit day started at 10 p.m., and we
                ended up hiking 17 hours that day. This was the most physical
                suffering I've ever endured‚Äìeven more than my Ironman.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
                Mt. Whitney (14,505 ft / 4,421 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In 2019, I organized 3 friends to climb the tallest mountain in
                the contiguous US. We started the climb at 2 am, and it took us
                17 hours to summit and descend. People usually split this climb
                into two days. We ran out of water near the summit, so one of us
                had to drink piss to survive (we filtered it).
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>
                Mt. Fuji (12,389 ft / 3,776 m)
              </summary>
              <p>
                In 2015, I organized 3 friends to "bullet climb" the tallest
                mountain in Japan, which means to summit and descend in a single
                push without staying overnight on the mountain. It took us 14
                hours total. It‚Äôs now forbidden to bullet climb Mt. Fuji because
                too many people have been injured from attempting it. My friends
                stopped hiking after this experience because of how challenging
                it was.
              </p>
            </details>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I've wanted to climb the Seven Summits (the highest mountain on each
            continent, including Mt. Everest) ever since I was a kid. I‚Äôve
            conquered one so far and have six more to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            üö¥üèª In 2021, I trained for and completed an Ironman Triathlon‚Äìa
            140.6-mile (226 km) endurance race consisting of a 2.4-mile swim, a
            112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile marathon, all done back-to-back.
            The race took place in Cozumel, Mexico, where it was 80&deg;F
            (27&deg;C) with 100% humidity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right after I crossed the finish line, I collapsed from hyponatremia
            and had to be carried to the infirmary on a stretcher. I was pretty
            scared‚Äìmy entire body was cramping, including my face, and I
            couldn't even open my fists. The race took me 15 hours to finish and
            it was the hardest physical thing I've ever done.
          </p>
          <p>
            üí™üèª I've also trained to do a muscle-up, land a standing backflip,
            and bench press 2 plates (225 lbs / 102 kg).
          </p>
          <h4>Fun facts</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area but didn‚Äôt grow up there.
              I moved back 4 years ago and am proud to call it my home.
            </li>

              Growing up, I lived in 3 countries and changed schools 7 times.

            <li>
              In high school, I voluntarily spent a summer being hazed at a
              military school in Kentucky. I wanted to go for the experience
              (and it was a great one). It shut down shortly after I left due to
              safety concern complaints from parents.
            </li>
            <li>
              I nearly failed high school with a 1.9 GPA (C- average) because I
              was playing League of Legends competitively (I made it to semi-pro
              on the Chinese server). I was also busy competing on 6 sports
              teams‚Äì4 varsity and 2 JV.

            <li>I've visited 25 countries and 6 continents.</li>
