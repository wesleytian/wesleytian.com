**–and it's not even over yet!**

Sometimes life just passes by and you forget to stop, take a deep breath, and reflect. I feel like that's recently been the case for me as I moved into a hacker house, got into a serious new relationship, and started a company.

However, I usually end up reflecting and it always ends up bringing me closure, satisfaction. Most of all, it helps me define my path forward. I'd recommend everyone reading this to reflect as well (if you don't already). If you need help, I'd start with listing out "what's happened", "how do you feel about what's happened," and "what you want to happen in the next year (or few)".

Below are the most significants events of my life from the past year or so, in chronological order. I've written down a ton of other thoughts in private, but I won't bore you with the details.
