## Me

Hi, my name is Wesley Y. Tian. I'm a founding member of [Virtually](https://tryvirtually.com/), the "Shopify" for Online Schools. Our mission is to make education more accessible and more affordable. 

As Virtually's first hire, I've helped out in multiple domains, but my forte is software engineering. We are currently a team of 12 (6 full-time) and are backed by [Afore Capital](https://afore.vc/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), [Tiger Global](https://www.tigerglobal.com/home), and talented angels such as [Eric Ries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries), [Li Fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Fan_(engineer)), and [Avlok Kohli](https://angel.co/p/avlok-kohli). We've raised over $2M to date.

Growing up around the world in the following places has inexplicably shaped my worldview:
- Mountain View, CA (age 0) 👶🏻
- San Jose metro area, CA (ages 1-4) 🇺🇸
- Portland metro area, OR (5-6) 🇺🇸
- Taipei, Taiwan (7-8) 🇹🇼
- Portland metro area, OR (8-9) 🇺🇸
- Shanghai, China (10-17) 🇨🇳
- Amherst, MA (19-20) 🇺🇸
- Ann Arbor, MI (21-23) 🇺🇸
- Reno, NV (24) 🇺🇸
- San Jose metro area, CA (soon!) 🇺🇸

I like learning, exercising (triathlon, hiking, calisthenics), calling friends and family, and writing in my free time.

I've previously worked at Microsoft as a Software Engineer, [Clinc](https://clinc.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer, and studied Computer Science, Data Science, and Entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan. Go Blue! 〽️

## This Site

This snippet below pretty much sums up the reasons why I continue to maintain this site. I found it [here](https://breakoutlist.com/career-planning/#step-8). Plus, it's like volunteering. It feels good to know that you're providing value to others. I've had dozens of people reach out to me about how my writing has inspired them. I've also been able to make friends and connections through this site.

> Key takeaway: Once you get hired, make an effort to spread what you are learning and
building. 

> I think this is a great point. If you occasionally blog about
what you've been learning, or open-source a small module, great things
happen. 

> You become a more interesting person (at least in the context
where most people will research you, i.e. online), and you contribute
knowledge back to the world. 

> Of course, this can do great things five
years down the track when you are thinking about your next move.
