## Me

Hi, my name is Wesley Tian. I'm a founding member of [Virtually](https://tryvirtually.com/), the "Shopify" for Online Schools. Our mission is to make education more accessible and more affordable. 

As Virtually's first hire, I've helped out in multiple domains, but my forte is software engineering. We are currently a team of 12 (6 full-time) and are backed by [Afore Capital](https://afore.vc/), [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), [Tiger Global](https://www.tigerglobal.com/home), and talented angels such as [Eric Ries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries), [Li Fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Fan_(engineer)), and [Avlok Kohli](https://angel.co/p/avlok-kohli). We've raised over $2M to date.

I grew up in California, Oregon, Taiwan, China, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Nevada (in that order).

When I'm not working, I'm reading, training for my Ironman, hanging out with friends and family, and writing.

I've previously worked on Microsoft's back end', [Clinc](https://clinc.com/)'s machine learning models, and studied computer science, data science, and entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan 〽️.

## This Site

This snippet below pretty much sums up the reasons why I continue to maintain this site. I found it [here](https://breakoutlist.com/career-planning/#step-8). Plus, it's like volunteering. It feels good to know that you're providing value to others. I've had dozens of people reach out to me about how my writing has inspired them. I've also been able to make friends and connections through this site.

> Key takeaway: Once you get hired, make an effort to spread what you are learning and
building. 

> I think this is a great point. If you occasionally blog about
what you've been learning, or open-source a small module, great things
happen. 

> You become a more interesting person (at least in the context
where most people will research you, i.e. online), and you contribute
knowledge back to the world. 

> Of course, this can do great things five
years down the track when you are thinking about your next move.
