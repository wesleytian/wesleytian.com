> ### Ironman Triathlon

> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

> _An Ironman Triathlon is one of a series of long-distance triathlon races organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC), consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.22-mile (42.20 km) run, raced in that order. It is widely considered one of the most difficult one-day sporting events in the world._

In this multi-part series, I'll go over my first-hand experience of training for an Ironman Triathlon and my reasons for doing so. In part one, I'll go over my monetary costs to date. In part two, I'll cover my day-to-day schedule and the overall time commitment required. In part three, I'll cover my reasons for attempting to complete an Ironman. Future parts such as my race experience and an overall reflection to be determined.

__Subtotal: ~$2800__

### Total: ~$5700

To put that in comparison, my car only costed me $4500.

No wonder why only 1% (50 of 4500) of the participants in Ironman California are in my age group (between the ages of 18-24). Without a decent wage (or sacrificing other luxuries), forking over $6K for a sport is incomprehensible. (Even if in my mind, a triathlon is four sports in one.) 

Fortunately, most of these are one time costs, and I'll be able to reuse most of this equipment for their individual sports or for future triathlon races.

Now that you know how much money I've already invested into this activity to achieve one of my life goals, stay tuned for __"How Much Time Does It Take? (Part 2)"__, where I talk about the biggest investment of all and perhaps the most important question, __"Why Am I Even Doing An Ironman? (Part 3)"__
