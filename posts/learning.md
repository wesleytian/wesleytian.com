Inspired by Eddie Morra (played by Bradley Cooper) from Limitless, I've decided to try and maximize my brain and potential. Since NZT (the drug from the movie that gives Eddie access to 100% of his brain)* isn't real and I haven't anything close (believe me, I've searched), my next best bet is to optimize my health in such a way that it'll still give me a large edge over people who aren't doing these things.

---

All in all, I've easily done weeks of research on optimizing my health. I've read pubmed papers, listened to David Sinclair (professor of genetics at Harvard), Andrew Huberman (professor of endocrinology at Stanford), and spoken to Michael (CEO and Co-Founder of Novos). I won't be adding all of my findings below because that is going to take forever (maybe I will someday), but it's widely accepted with plenty of evidence that all of the following are good for you, with the exception of Longkat Ali and NMN which could use more clinical trials. I'm just sharing with you what changes I've made to my life as a result of my research. Feel free to use this as a starting point for optimizing your own health.

Additionally, what works for me may not work for you. The following are things that I've tried on my body and have seemed to work well. For example, I'm more sensitive to certain things like temperature while sleeping than others blue light before bed. 

To support maximizing my productivity and learning:

1. Sleep
- Total darkness
- Cold temperature
- Wake up to sunlight naturally (can mimic by using certain devices)
- Extremely quiet, some white noise
- Magnesium Threonate an hour before bed
- No melatonin

2. Diet
Other health habits, many of which were developed years ago.
- No processed foods
- Minimze added sugar
  - Causes aging and crashes
- No dairy
  - Causes aging
- No refined carbs (I only eat vegetables and fruits)
  - Causes aging and crashes
- 5 eggs/day for the choline and other nutrients
  - Eggs are one of the most nutrient dense foods on the planet and it's easy to see whyâ€“an egg yolk contains all the nutrients that a chicken needs
- Red meat once a week, fish and poultry 6x/week-

My diet pretty much consists strictly of fruits (raspberries, blueberries, pineapples, honeycrisp apples, bananas, green grapes, and strawberries), vegetables (broccoli, spinach, garlic, and kale, avocados), eggs, fish (cod, tilapia, salmon), poultry (chicken thighs, chicken legs), nuts (cashews). I'll also take a few bites of cake or chips from time to time.

Lunch- 5 eggs, 1 serving of vegetables, 1 serving of fruits (500 calories)  
Snack- 1 serving of nuts (200 calories)  
Dinner - 1 serving of chicken/fish, 1 serving of vegetables, 1 serving of fruits (600 calories)

I'll also eat out 3-4 meals/week because socializing over food is one of the best ways to bond, it's good, and I enjoy trying new foods.

3. Exercise
Strength train 3x/week
Cardio 3x/week (basketball, swimming, running)
- AHA and Harvard Health recommendations

4. Other things that I'm doing to help me learn quickly and be more productive with my time is taking supplements. Not all of these support brain function. Some of these support longevity.

I'm taking the following to support my diet and for other reasons, longevity, testosterone, focus, (contrary to popular belief, it's virtually impossible to obtain all of required nutrients for peak performance from foods alone):
- Vitamin D3
- Calcium Citrate
- Longkat Ali
  - https://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Article/2021/04/30/Tongkat-Ali-may-help-regulate-hormones-in-young-men-Study
  - https://www.nowfoods.com/healthy-living/articles/testojack-300-bioavailability-study
  - Don't take on empty stomach
  - 2 pills a day, TestoJack 300, 600mg
- Creatine
  - 2.5g/day
- NMN
  - 250mg
- Caffeine and Theanine (in the form of green tea)
  - I drink this 90-120 minutes after waking to allow my cortisol levels to naturally rise. It blocks adenosine, a molecule that causes sleepiness and as cortisol rises, so does adenosine. If you block it all immediately after waking, the adenosine will build up a lot more and cause a stronger decrease once the caffeine wears off. 
  - This is pretty much the most effective thing for focus for me. 

I'm also planning on testing out NR, Moda, and .

I also do want to enjoy life so if I eat out, I disregard all of my above dietary restrictions.

Additionally, I'll be planning something to do for every hour of the week.

Now, what am I going to do with all of this extra focus, time, longevity, testosterone, etc.?


First, I'm going to learn some new langages, starting with Spanish. Second, I'm going to read some non-fiction for an hour each night. I'm also trying to work on some side projects that generate revenue, learn science, and physics. I also want to write more. I'll write slightly better when I know that somebody may read it, and it's also a good way for me to summarize what I've learned. If I can't explain it, then I didn't understand something. Rewriting something in your own words (think back to grade school) is also a great way to learn in itself.

Let's see how this goes. If this goes well, I'll be fluent in Spanish, Arabic, and German in a few years (500-600 hours each). 

I'll document my journey here.

I started learning Spanish via Duolingo yesterday, with 0 knowledeg of Spanish. I spent 30 minutes trying to figure out the best app for learning Spanish and it turns out that it's Babbel. 

The current plan is to do nine lessons a week on Babbel, but since each lesson only takes 5 minutes, I've already done more than nine in two days.

I used to think that I was too anal about my health, but as I've gotten older and talked to more people, I've realized that doing these thingsn growing up has really benefited me a lot in terms of productivity and general well-being. My cholestrol levels are incredibly good (will post my blood test results in a bit.), incredibly efficient hearth (low RHR), I am very strong and balanced (225 lb bench at 165, dip + 115lb+, one hand pushups, two finger pushups, pistol squats on a bosu ball, etc.)

5/12: 
- As an incredibly curious person, it's probably important that I don't just learn about everything that piques my curiosity. It's quite easy for me to go down rabbit holes. Today, I realized I never knew what the p in 1080p meant so I learned about interlaced vs. progressive scan video content (the p doesn't stand for pixels). I was going to learn about why coaxial cables limit bandwidth so much vs. fiber cables. But, because I had other work to do (work work, housing stuff, etc.) I decided to stop, probably for the better.

- I had a conversation with a co-worker today abouth his experience with Adderall. He used it in college and is considering using it again for work. It might be worth trying. I've tried Ritalin in college, but perhaps because it was a slow-release variant and I only took half the standard dose, I didn't feel anything.

- I'm going to try and be more intentional about what I learn and what I spend my time on, instead of learning and reading about random things. Or is it okay to just learn about what interests you? I'm honestly not sure. If you have thoughts, let me know.

*Yes, I know it's a myth that we only use 10% of our brain. But that's just the premise of the movie. The point is that NZT made Eddie superhumanly smart.
