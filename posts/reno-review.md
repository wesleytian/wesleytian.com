Not even 9 months since I made the bold decision to move to Reno, Nevada, I've decided to leave. I wrote about my reasons for moving here last August, and it boiled down to three primary reasons: 

1. I wanted to be closer to nature (Lake Tahoe, the Sierra Nevada mountain range, and National Parks) during the pandemic as bustling cities lost their value. 
2. I was helping found a startup and wanted to live cheaply.
3. I still wanted to be somewhat close to my friends and family, most of whom live in the San Francisco Bay Area.

What's changed?
After making multiple day trips to the Bay Area during the weekends to visit friends, I started to realize that it wasn't sustainable. Pairing that with the fact that it becomes much harder to make friends as you grow older (add some links, add the one from wait but why and ), I wanted to be closer to my friends and hang out with them more often.

Thus, even if the cost of living is going to a bit more expensive and I'd be farther from Lake Tahoe, the sole reason of being closer to friends  was enough to make me move to the Bay.

Obviously, this is quite a personal reason, so besides the fact that my friends and family are still pretty far from Reno, how is it living here?

## Nature
The natural environments within a 30-minute drive from Reno are truly breathtaking. Lake Tahoe has got to be the most beautiful lake on Planet Earth. The water is so blue and crystal clear that it looks like somebody photoshopped it. There's no trash and during the colder months, there's not a single human in sight.

An actual picture I took.

I also had the chance to visit a couple of other natural areas near Reno. A few friends and I rented a cabin in Yosemite National Park for Thanksgiving, my girlfriend and I drove to Great Basin National Park, car camped and did some hiking, and I climbed a few mountains such as Mt. Rose.

Mt. rose picture. Great basin picture.

Would I consider buying a house on the Lake Tahoe shore one day? Absolutely. (If I win the lottery that is. (laughing emoji) The houses there are mad expensive.) Find pricing of avg lakeshore house?

Before it got kinda cold and snowy in the mountains, I would also go trail running just 10 minutes away from where I live. I would be able to go hiking as a break during the middle of a workday.

## Weather/climate
When I first got here, the one thing that I noticed immediately was how dry it was. During my runs for the first few months, just breathing was painful. I haven't felt that since winter though, so perhaps my body has adapted to it. 

Other than that, the summer and fall here were amazing, it literally never rained a single day and was always sunny with blue skies. Just as what you'd expect from living in a desert. 

It does get kind of cold in Reno during the winter months. It's much better than Michigan but still cold enough that it makes outdoor activities less enjoyable. Besides my morning runs, I stopped going hiking during the winter.

Usually, this is when people switch to skiing, snowboarding, and other snow sports. I was never really a skier so I didn't really get into it until some friends from eth Bay came to Lake Tahoe to ski. And unfortunately by that time, my Ironman training was underway and there's only so much time during the weekends.

## Living
One of the main reasons why I decided to move to Reno was because of the cost of living. Not only do I not have to pay state income taxes, but the housing is also much cheaper than many other places in the USA. Our completely furnished and newly remodeled 750 sq. ft. 1Br/Ba with a parking space and porch was only $1400, compared to like an average of $2500 for an unfurnished, decrepit apartemnt in the Bay Area.

Our floors are laminate, we have an in-unit washer and dryer, a new quiet dishwasher, a smart thermostat, hot water, like new furnshings,new bedding, towels and more. The first day that we moved in, after telling my landlord that we hadn't gone grocery shopping for food yet, she came by to drop off some bagels, cream cheese, and orange juice. In contrast, when one of my bay Area frieds' had rat problems, their landlord didn't even call pest control and just placed some traps in their home. What a difference between low and high demand markets.


## City
I didn't really get to explore the city cgause of the pandemic. My initial reason for moving to Reno wasn't for the city, but for it's proximity to nature. In a normal year, I would've gone to flight shows, went gambling, and possibly visit the Buring Man (Reno is the closest city to it). However, I only went to downtown Reno to pick up takeout, get my car fixed/washed, and visit the bike shop. Did it seem nice on the few occasions that I visited? There were a few homeless people near the river, but yeah, it wasn't too bad. It was definitely on the smaller side.

I'm planning on coming back to Reno once everything opens up again and see how I like the city then. It's unfortunate that I wasn't really able to explore the city.


## People
Reno is way more politically diverse than most other places I've lived inâ€“compared to the last two places I lived, Amherst, MA; and Ann Arbor MI at least. Not only did I see Bernie and Biden flags during my runs in nearby neighborhoods, but I also saw plenty of Trump flags. I don't think I've ever lived in an area where adjacent neighbors had both Trump and Bernie/Biden flags. It was quite the sight.

I never really got to interact with too many people here besides the occasional wave or greeting during my runs or walks. People seemed pretty friendly and although there seems to be a lot of anti-Asian rhetoric recently, I haven't felt that here. One of my neighbors let me know that I had car's dome lights were on, and people that I met on hikes were pretty friendly, too. I did get yelled at a few times when I was driving, but that was because the traffic laws slightly vary from those in Michigan and I made some wrong turns.

Oh, and when I run I also pass a store that sells Tactical Equipment (AR15s). It's literally like 5 minutes from where I live. PRetty interesting. I've definitely thought about purchasing a gun (probably not an AR15, just a gun for fun/home/self defense) since it's pretty easy and legal here, but haven't really felt the need to, yet. Also  I'm not sure if I'd be able to bring it to California. I think they have stricter laws there.

Summary
Overall, Reno has great weather and nature for sure and I would consider moving back here one day if I had some friends or family in the area. I didn't really get to meet that many people here, but they seemed friendly, and the city seemed fine, even if it was a bit small and lacked some good Asian food. I hope to come back one day and check it out a bit more.
