It's only been than three months since I've moved to San Francisco, yet I've met more people, made more friends, and attended more parties in these past months than I have in the past two years prior.

San Francisco is definitely back* and I'm so glad to have finally moved to the land of dreams.

Finding my co-living house in February was a godsend. I was able to immediately form close connections and expand my network by combining all seven of my housemate's networks and by throwing parties. Co-living houses are so common in San Francisco that there are even mixers between different houses. I was finally able to live the frat life that I never got the chance to experience in college. Go Aurora! We've attended events at the [Elysian House](https://coda.io/@trustinyoon/elysianhouse), [Genesis House](https://www.deugenesis.com/), Dropout Dorm, and the "Van". Some of these houses are web3-centered (Elysian), while others focus on deep tech (Genesis).

We hosted a ton of parties and went out so much. We've danced at Arena, Temple, Butter, Halcyon, Monrose, and Westwood. We've walked through Portero Hill, Mission Bay, Russian Hill, Hayes Valley, Nob Hill (Polk St), Little Italy (North Beach) Cow Hollow, Pac Heights, Japantown, Chinatown, Marina, Union Square, Civic Center. We've gone to equally as many 15 million dollar mansion parties as we have sweaty warehouse parties.

Perhaps I'm still in my honeymoon phase with SF, but I'm in love. Sure, there are areas with homelessness and feces on sidewalks, but those are far and few in between, virtually none if you avoid certain areas of the city like the Tenderloin. The beauty of the endless number of parks, the absence of tall poppy syndrome, and likely the densest population of overachievers on Earth makes this a truly one of a kind place. In fact, excellent satire like [Every Bay Area House Party by Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/every-bay-area-house-party?s=r) may seem exaggerated to the uninitiated, but from personal experience, could absurdly be truth.

Sometimes my friends and I will be chatting about something and burst out laughing after realizing how absurd we would sound to a non-SF-startup-web3-techie (normal person). A recent example was how I was explaining to my friends a fusion (energy) DAO that I'm working on, which is similar to VitaDao (a DAO for funding longevity research). They use Snapshot for voting and to vote on proposals, and in order to do that, you need to purchase their tokens using WETH on CowSwap. One of my good friends is working on a startup to redirect validator yields on Celo for social good like offsetting carbon by retiring on chain carbon credits using the Toucan protocol. These conversations that used to be a jumble of foreign words to me are now just mundane noise in my daily chatters. And it's not just conversations in the web3 space, it's also conversations about philosophy (nihilism), economics, finance, space, nuclear fusion, longevity (gerontology), and of course AI. 

Growing up, I used to always feel like I knew much more than my peers about arcane subjects, but here, I'm just another poppy. You overhear conversations about HFT at the climbing gym, and hear people use phrases such as local optimas and binary search to explain daily subjects. Nearly everyone you meet can code and drop outs are the norm. In fact there are entire communities built around college drop outs. And when I say dropout, I don't mean somebody who dropped out because they didn't know what to d owith their life. I mean high school (yes, high school), and college dropouts who have raised millions of dollars to work on their startups.

I have honestly never been in a place with this many hardworking smart people in one place. And more often than not, these smart people aren't just academically smart with good pedigrees, but are also charismatic and have expertise and interests in multiple domains.
It's also incredible that everyone is within one or two connections away from one another, including people on Tinder and Hinge.

What's next?

I'll be moving from my current co-living house of eight 21-26 year olds in Nob Hill to the Civic Center with Victor Maher. These past few months have been crazy fun, but now I've had my fill and it's time to get back on the grind**. At the beginning of 2022, I had one new year's resolution: to have more fun as I had been grinding for the past two years––first on a startup and then for an Ironman. 

It's perfect timing as I'm also moving into a new place in a few weeks. I'll be able to form a more consistent routine and also get my health back in check after these past months of binging around 10 standard drinks every weekend.  

I'm incredibly looking forward to my next phase of life, moving to the civic center in one of the most luxurious apartment buildings in SF, start swimming, and playing basketball again, meet other overachieving, hardworking yuppies, and create something of value to people. I'll continue to meet people here and there, but in a much more intentional manner, and I'll continue trying to eat at every Michelin restaruant that has one the Bib Gourmand award (award for good quality and good value cooking as opposed to the more experimental dishes that Michelin star restaurants are most commonly known for).

If I were to name my past phase of life "SF degeneracy". My next phase will be called "value creation".

*referring to everything being closed in SF for much longer than other cities due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.

**for most people in my stage of life, my previous SF lifestyle of binge drinking and going out every weekend is the norm. However, to accomplish great things (which I want), you also need to work harder than most. Hard work is obviously not the only ingredient, but it is a necessary one.
