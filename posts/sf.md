It's only been than three months since I've moved to San Francisco, yet I've met more people, made more friends, and attended more parties in these past three months than in the past two years.

San Francisco is definitely back* and I'm so glad to have finally moved to the land of dreams.

Finding Aurora house, my current co-living house, in February was a godsend. I was able to immediately form close connections and expand my network by combining all seven of my housemate's networks and by throwing parties. Co-living houses are so common in San Francisco that there are even mixers between different houses. I was finally able to live the frat life that I never got the chance to experience in college. We often visited other co-living houses such as [Elysian House](https://coda.io/@trustinyoon/elysianhouse), [Genesis House](https://www.deugenesis.com/), and Dropout Dorm. Some of these houses are web3-centered (Elysian), while others focus on deep tech (Genesis).

We hosted a ton of parties and went out nearly every weekend. We danced at Arena, Temple, Butter, Halcyon, Monrose, and Westwood. We walked through Russian Hill, Hayes Valley, Nob Hill (Polk St), Little Italy (North Beach) Cow Hollow, Pac Heights, Japantown, Chinatown, Marina. We went to equally many 15 million dollar mansion parties as sweaty warehouse parties.

Perhaps I'm still in my honeymoon phase with SF, but I'm in love. Sure, there are areas with homelessness and feces on sidewalks, but those are far and few between–virtually none if you avoid certain areas of the city like the Tenderloin. The beauty of the endless number of parks, the absence of the tall poppy syndrome, and likely the densest population of overachievers on Earth makes this a truly one of a kind place. In fact, excellent satire like [Every Bay Area House Party by Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/every-bay-area-house-party?s=r) may seem exaggerated to the uninitiated, but from personal experience, could absurdly be true.

Sometimes my friends and I will be chatting about something and burst out laughing after realizing just how absurd we would sound to a non-SF-startup-web3-techie (normal person). Recently, I was explaining to some friends about a fusion (energy) DAO that I was working on. I explained that it was similar to VitaDao and that you can use tokens purchased using WETH on CowSwap to vote on proposals via Snapshot. Another recent conversation was explaining one of my friend's startups. What he's working on is a DAO to redirect validator yields on Celo to social good projects like offsetting carbon by retiring on chain carbon credits using the Toucan protocol. These conversations that used to be a jumble of foreign words to me are now nothing but mundane noise in daily chatter. And it's not just intellectual conversations in the web3 space, it's also conversations about startups, SaaS, VC, philosophy, economics, finance, space, nuclear fusion, longevity, nootropics, nutrition, and of course AI. 

Growing up, I always felt like I had so much more knowledege about random subjects than my peers. But here, I'm just another poppy. In SF, you overhear conversations about HFT at the climbing gym and hear people use phrases such as local optimas and binary search to explain daily subjects. Nearly everyone you meet can code and dropouts are the norm. In fact there are entire communities built around college dropouts who have raised millions of dollars for their startups. There's also elite gay cabals (but that's a story for another time).

I have never lived in a place with this many hardworking and smart people. And more often than not, these smart people aren't just academically smart with good pedigrees, but are also charismatic and have expertise and interests in multiple domains.
It's also incredible that everyone is one or two connections away from each other, including high-status people like Sam Altman and my Hinge matches.

At the beginning of 2022, I had one new year's resolution: to have more fun. I had been grinding for the past two years––first on a startup and then for an Ironman and I needed a break. I guess I can say I accomplished what I set out to do.

These past few months have been crazy fun, but now I've had my fill and it's time to get back on the grind**. It's perfect timing, as in a few days, I'll be moving from my current co-living house of seven other 21-26 year olds in the popping Victorian-style Polk St area to a high-rise closer to downtown SF with Victor Maher. I'll meet other overachieving, hardworking yuppies in the building's lounge and library and continue working on projects on weekends until one of them brings enough value to people so that I can raise funding. Equally importantly, I'm looking forward to bring back a sense of routine and get my health back in check after these past months of heavy drinking and staying out late.

 I'll continue to meet people here and there but ideally in a much more intentional manner as to be more productive with time. There are plenty of parks that I've yet to see, clubs to do more degenerate shit at, and neighborhoods to walk through. My apartment in the Civic Center is right next to the Opera House, Symphony Hall, SF Public Library, SF City Hall, Asian Art Museum, Hayes Valley, Bill Graham Auditorium, and more. I'm also prepared to take advantage of the building's comprehensive amenities to start swimming and playing basketball again. 
 
 If I were to name this ending phase of my life, I'd name it "SF degeneracy". Next up: "value creation". I can't wait.

*referring to everything being closed in SF for much longer than other cities due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.

**for most people in my stage of life, my previous SF lifestyle of binge drinking and going out every weekend is pretty normal. However, to accomplish great things (which I want), you also need to work harder than most. Hard work is obviously not the only ingredient, but it is a necessary one.
